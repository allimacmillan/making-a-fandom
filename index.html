        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Shane Dawson is considered to be an "original youtuber," meaning he has been on the
          platform for much longer than many of the current popular youtubers. He started on the platform
          in 2008, making mostly short comedy sketch videos. Later, he became very popular from his conspiracy
          theory videos. Some are believable and very true, while others are a little more far-fetched. Recently,
          he has had success with a new format of content: docu-series. One popular series that he created
          is an in-depth look at the life of Jake Paul, a younger popular YouTuber. Dawson has now done
          several of these docu-series-style videos and they have brought him great success. The most recent
          of these is the "Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson" 2-part series. He now lives in Los Angeles with
          his boyfriend Ryland (who is also a youtuber), their two dogs, and cat. He has amassed over 20 million
          subscribers on YouTube.

        <h2>Video Style</h2>
        <p>
          Dawson is known for his unique energy and editing style. He includes quick inserts of images and sounds
          and talks in a very animated voice. He always uses dramatic background music to make the scenario seem
          more intense. He seems to find the drama and, as he likes to call it, "tea" in every possibly sketchy
          situation. He and his videographer Andrew Siwicki do a really good job of finding clips of other YouTubers,
          news clips, and any outside video they can find that will support their narrative. His more recent
          style of creating YouTube docu-series' is incredibly focused on the narrative of the story instead of
          simply one video about topics with no real story progression. This new narrative version of video has
          been incredibly successful for Dawson, with his most-watched video now at 35 million views.
